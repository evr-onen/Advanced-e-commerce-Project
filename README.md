Calistigim yer kuculmeye gittigi icin isten ayrilmak zorunda kaldim. Bu proje sonrasinda yaptigim bir proje. Neler ogrendimi gostermek amaciyla ve ayni zamanda bildiklerimi pekistirmek icin yaptigim bir proje. Oyuzden tasarimla cok ugrasmadim. Yazilima o zamanlar yeni oldugum icin isin teknik kisimlarini gostermek istedim. 
Bu projede next.js Typescript kullanildi. Backend yerine context api kullandim. React-hook-form UseFieldArray DnD yup swiper sweetalert gibi librariler kullanildi

I had to leave my job because the place I was working was downsizing. This project is a project I did afterwards. It was a project to show what I had learned and at the same time to reinforce what I knew. That's why I didn't bother much with the design, I wanted to show the technical side of things since I was new to software at the time. 
Next.js Typescript was used in this project. I used context api instead of backend. I used libraries like React-hook-form UseFieldArray DnD yup swiper sweetalert...
